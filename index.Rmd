# <small> What we did last week... </small>

----

We talked about the scientific <br>
process by looking at the <br>
hypothetico-deductive model

----

Then we talked about how <br>
to make it more open

----

And finally we talked <br>
about potential problems <br>
related to open science

----

Any questions or anything to add?

## <small> Preregistration </small>

Eight questions to preregistration at:  

<a href=https://aspredicted.org/">https://aspredicted.org/</a>

----

Please take 5 minutes to discuss <br>
with your neighbors what you think <br>
would be important questions

----

What's the main question being <br>
asked or hypothesis being tested <br>
in this study?

----

Describe the key dependent <br>
variable(s) specifying how <br>
they will be measured.

----

How many and which conditions <br>
will participants be assigned to?

----

Specify exactly which analyses <br>
you will conduct to examine the <br>
main question/hypothesis.

----

Any secondary analyses?

----

How many observations will be <br>
collected or what will determine <br>
sample size? <br>
No need to justify decision, but <br>
be precise about exactly how the <br>
number will be determined.

----

Anything else you would like to pre-register? <br>
(e.g., data exclusions, variables collected <br>
for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?)

----

Have any data been collected <br>
for this study already?
